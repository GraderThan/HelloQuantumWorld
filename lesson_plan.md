#### **Teacher's Notes**

- **Key Concepts to Emphasize:**
  - Classical bits vs. quantum bits.
  - Introducing the idea of multiple states simultaneously.

---

### **2. Background Knowledge Activation (5 minutes)**

#### **Review Classical Computing**

- **Bits:**
  - Remind students that classical computers use **bits** as the smallest unit of data, which can be either a **0** or a **1**.

- **Binary System:**
  - Briefly explain how bits form the basis of all computing tasks, from simple calculations to complex graphics.

#### **Teacher's Notes**

- **Explanation:**
  - Bits are like switches: **on (1)** or **off (0)**.

- **Analogies:**
  - Light switches, true/false statements.

---

### **3. Direct Instruction: Quantum Basics (15 minutes)**

#### **Introduce Quantum Computing**

- **Qubits:**
  - Explain that quantum computers use **qubits**, which, unlike bits, can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

#### **Concept of Superposition**

- **Explanation:**
  - In classical terms, a bit is like a coin lying flat on a table showing either heads (**1**) or tails (**0**).
  - A **qubit** is like a spinning coin; while it's spinning, it's not just heads or tails—it's in a state of **both** until it stops and we observe the outcome.

- **Demonstration:**
  - Spin a large coin in front of the class to illustrate **superposition**.

#### **Concept of Entanglement**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Entanglement** is a phenomenon where two qubits become linked, and the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.

- **Analogy:**
  - Use the analogy of a **pair of gloves**: if you find one left-hand glove in a box, you instantly know the other glove is right-hand, even if it's far away.

#### **Importance of Measurement**

- **Observation Effect:**
  - In quantum mechanics, the act of **measuring** a qubit forces it into one of the definite states (**0** or **1**).
  - Until measurement, it's in a **superposition** of all possible states.

#### **Teacher's Cheat Sheet**

- **Classical Bits vs. Qubits:**

  - **Classical Bits:**
    - Can be **0** or **1**.
    - Like a coin showing heads or tails.

  - **Qubits:**
    - Can be **0**, **1**, or **both 0 and 1 simultaneously**.
    - Like a spinning coin, representing superposition.

- **Superposition:**

  - **Definition:**
    - A qubit's ability to be in multiple states at once.

  - **Analogy:**
    - Spinning coin.

  - **Explanation:**
    - Allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of possibilities simultaneously.

- **Entanglement:**

  - **Definition:**
    - Two qubits become linked; the state of one instantly affects the other.

  - **Analogy:**
    - Pair of gloves; knowing one tells you about the other.

  - **Explanation:**
    - Enables powerful quantum computations and instantaneous state changes.

- **Measurement and Observation Effect:**

  - Measuring a qubit forces it into a definite state.
  - Until measurement, it's in superposition.

- **Step 2:**
  - Ask students to **spin** their coins and observe.
  - While the coin spins, ask:
    - **"Is the coin showing heads or tails?"**
      - **Answer:** It's continuously changing; it's **both** until it stops.

#### **Discussion**

- **Relate to Superposition:**
  - Explain that the spinning coin represents a **qubit in superposition**, embodying both states simultaneously.

- **Key Question:**
  - **"How does this activity help us understand the difference between bits and qubits?"**

#### **Teacher's Cheat Sheet**
