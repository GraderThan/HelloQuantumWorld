    "1. **Entanglement** means the qubits are linked in a way that their states are correlated. When we entangle qubits, measuring one qubit gives us information about the other, even if they‚Äôre physically separated. In our circuit, we entangled the qubits using a Hadamard gate on the first qubit followed by a controlled-X (CX) gate, which creates a specific kind of correlation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"ZZ\" and \"XX\" Observables**: The \"ZZ\" observable measures the correlation in the phase states of both qubits, while \"XX\" measures the correlation in their flip states. Since both observables show high values close to 1, this means that:\n",
    "   - When we measure one qubit in the **Z-basis** (related to \"ZZ\"), we get a predictable outcome for the other.\n",
    "   - Similarly, measuring in the **X-basis** (related to \"XX\") also gives consistent, correlated results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   These strong correlations in both Z and X measurements indicate that the qubits are entangled because the outcome of measuring one qubit directly influences the expected result of the other, regardless of the basis (phase or flip).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the high \"ZZ\" and \"XX\" values are evidence of entanglement, as they\n",
    "show the qubits' states are connected in a way that one qubit‚Äôs measurement\n",
    "affects the other.\n",
